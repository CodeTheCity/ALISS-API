Team ALISS API at Code The City #9 - Health

Api deployed at:

(Allows all origins)

hosted demo site at http://www.aboynejames.co.uk/codethecity/linkedservices/

## Links
- Aliss source code and documentation: https://github.com/aliss/engine

## Proposed improvements
- Search by event date (not supported by any of the database API's at the moment)

## Other ideas
- Return "where to get there" information for locations, for example using google maps navigation
- Add pictures of the building (next to the map?) to make it easier to find
